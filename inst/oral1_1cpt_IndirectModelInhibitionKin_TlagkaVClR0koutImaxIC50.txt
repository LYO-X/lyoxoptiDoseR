DESCRIPTION:
PKPD model. The PK data must be tagged with the lowest OBSERVATION ID value. 
The administration is extravascular with a first order absorption (rate constant ka) and a lag time (Tlag).
The PK model has one compartment (volume V) and a linear elimination (clearance Cl).
The PD model is an indirect turnover model with inhibition of the production (baseline response R0, degradation rate kout, 
maximal fraction of inhibition Imax, and half-maximal inhibitory concentration IC50).

PK:
;====== PK part of the model

; PK model definition 
Cc = pkmodel(Tlag, ka, V, Cl)

EQUATION:
;====== PD part of the model

; Initial values
R_0 = R0
                               
; Parameter transformation
kin = R0 * kout
                               
; ODE for the response
ddt_R = kin * (1 - Imax * Cc/(Cc+IC50)) - kout * R 

OUTPUT: 
output = {Cc, R}
